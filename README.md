# Abstract_Factory-Design_Pattern

- This module gives a demo on Abstract Factory Design Pattern in JAVA with its implementation code, why to use it, where to use it, advantages & disadvantages, how to implement, etc...

- Abstract Factory design pattern is one of the Creational pattern. 
- Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern.
- Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.
- Abstract factory pattern implementation provides us with a framework that allows us to create objects that follow a general pattern. 
- So at runtime, the abstract factory is coupled with any desired concrete factory which can create objects of the desired type.
