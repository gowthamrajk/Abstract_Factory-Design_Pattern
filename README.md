# Abstract_Factory-Design_Pattern ‚ù§Ô∏è

- This module gives a demo on Abstract Factory Design Pattern in JAVA with its implementation code, why to use it, where to use it, advantages & disadvantages, how to implement, etc...

## About Abstract Factory Pattern ü•Ö
- Abstract Factory design pattern is one of the Creational pattern. 
- Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern.
- Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.
- Abstract factory pattern implementation provides us with a framework that allows us to create objects that follow a general pattern. 
- So at runtime, the abstract factory is coupled with any desired concrete factory which can create objects of the desired type.

## Advantage of Abstract Factory Pattern üìå

- Abstract Factory Pattern isolates the client code from concrete (implementation) classes.
- It eases the exchanging of object families.
- It promotes consistency among objects.

## Usage of Abstract Factory Pattern üì∫
- When the system needs to be independent of how its object are created, composed, and represented.
- When the family of related objects has to be used together, then this constraint needs to be enforced.
- When you want to provide a library of objects that does not show implementations and only reveals interfaces.
- When the system needs to be configured with one of a multiple family of objects.
